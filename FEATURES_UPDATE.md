# Features Component Enhancement

## Changes Made

### 1. **Merged Stigma Support and Crisis Detection**
- Combined "Stigma Support" and "Crisis Detection" into a single feature: **"Stigma Support & Crisis Care"**
- This makes sense since both features redirect to the same `/stigma-support` page
- The merged feature now has enhanced description highlighting both stigma support and crisis detection capabilities
- Added a shield icon with pulsing animation to indicate the importance of crisis detection

### 2. **Rolling Door/Accordion Design**
- **Expandable Cards**: Each feature card can now be clicked to expand and show detailed information

  - Hover effects with scale transforms and color changes
  - Left border highlights on hover and expansion
  - Icon rotations and scaling effects
  - Smooth transitions for all interactive elements

### 3. **New Design Elements**
