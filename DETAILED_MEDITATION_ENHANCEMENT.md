## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Script Structure:

```

### Formatting Function:
```typescript
const formatMeditationScript = (script: string) => {
  return script
    .replace(/\*\*(.*?)\*\*/g, '<strong>$1</strong>')
    .split('\n')
    .map(line => {
      if (line.trim().startsWith('**') && line.trim().endsWith('**')) {
        return `<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary mt-4 mb-2">${line.replace(/\*\*/g, '')}</h3>`;
      }
      return line;
    })
    .join('\n');
};
```
